# whichever-data

### Description
A module with some functions making it easier to accept a wide range of binary-data holding objects like Array, TypedArray, DataView, ArrayBuffer and Node.js's Buffer as input without having to actually know which of them were used as the input.

### Example

```js
import {dataToTypedArray} from 'whichever-data'

function giveMeAnyData(data) {
  const uint32array = dataToTypedArray(data, Uint32Array)
  // do something amazing here
}
```

### Supported platforms

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Deno](https://deno.land/)
* A proper browser ([Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) based usually)

### Documentation

#### dataToTypedArray(data, TypedArray)

Creates a TypedArray of the chosen type from an Array, another TypedArray, DataView, ArrayBuffer or Node.js Buffer. When not created from an Array it doesn't copy any data, instead it will create a view into the underlying ArrayBuffer (hence changes in the viewed data will also affect the content of this TypedArray).

#### dataToArrayBuffer(data)

Copies the viewed part of the underlying ArrayBuffer from the supplied object (e.g. DataView, TypedArray or Node.js Buffer). Or if supplied an array it treats it like unsigned bytes and creates the ArrayBuffer from it. If supplied an ArrayBuffer it creates a copy of it.

#### dataToDataView(data)

Creates a DataView from a TypedArray, DataView, ArrayBuffer, Node.js Buffer or an Array (of unsigned bytes). When not created from an Array it doesn't copy any data, instead it will create a view into the underlying ArrayBuffer (hence changes in the viewed data will also affect the content of this DataView).

### The bottom

You reached the bottom, good. Most people just skim the top... But I guess that you have an attention to detail and a higher intelligence than the average person. I like you! ðŸ˜ƒ
